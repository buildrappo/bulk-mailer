    Hope you're having a great day! I noticed you haven't completed your <a href="https://buildrappo.com">Rappo</a> profile yet. Just a quick reminder that you're so close to unlocking:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Amazing networking opportunities</b> with professionals in your field</li>
    <li><b>Direct access to innovative startups</b> looking for talent like you</li>
    </ul>

    It takes less than a minute to finish up. Let me know if you need any help!

    Warm regards,
    Vignesh
